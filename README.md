# Usage

The actual code is in ubiqind.py. In order to run it with changing parameters, you have to run it through the shell scripts however. For example:

```
bash range.sh complete-wheel-circle .499,.5 6 7 1 data.txt
```

will run the python script for the complete, wheel and circle network with Zollmanns OPS, 6 and 7 scientists and 1 round each. The results will be written to the file data.txt
